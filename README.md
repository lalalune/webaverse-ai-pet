# Webaverse AI Pet With Magick

This is a demonstration of creating a pet in Webaverse and using Magick as an AI brain backend.

You can get Magick here, it's free and open source: https://github.com/Oneirocom/MagickML

Make sure you add your OpenAI key to the .env in Magick. Import the webaverse_ai_pet.spell.json file into Magick.

You can add the pet to a scene, or drag the entire folder onto a running build of Webaverse.
